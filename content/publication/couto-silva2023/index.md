abstract: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Ecological conditions in the Amazon rainforests are historically favorable for the transmission of numerous tropical diseases, especially vector-borne diseases. The high diversity of pathogens likely contributes to the strong selective pressures for human survival and reproduction in this region. However, the genetic basis of human adaptation to this complex ecosystem remains unclear. This study investigates the possible footprints of genetic adaptation to the Amazon rainforest environment by analyzing the genomic data of 19 native populations. The results based on genomic and functional analysis showed an intense signal of natural selection in a set of genes related to Trypanosoma cruzi infection, which is the pathogen responsible for Chagas disease, a neglected tropical parasitic disease native to the Americas that is currently spreading worldwide.</p>"

summary: This study analyzed the genomes of native Amazon populations, finding evidence of genetic adaptation to combat Chagas disease, a prevalent tropical illness in the region.
