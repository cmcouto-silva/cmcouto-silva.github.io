As a highly skilled data scientist with a PhD in bioinformatics and over ten years of working on relevant projects, I developed a strong data science and analytics foundation. I have spent the last few years working at world-renowned companies, developing end-to-end machine learning applications. Additionally, driven by my passion for knowledge, I've taught specialized courses in various data science topics.
