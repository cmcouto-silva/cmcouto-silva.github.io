abstract: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The Andean Altiplano has been occupied continuously since the late Pleistocene, ~12,000 years ago, which places the Andean natives as one of the most ancient populations living at high altitudes. In the present study, we analyzed genomic data from Native Americans living a long-time at Andean high altitude and at Amazonia and Mesoamerica lowland areas. We have identified three new candidate genes - _SP100_, _DUOX2_ and _CLC_ - with evidence of positive selection for altitude adaptation in Andeans. These genes are involved in the _TP53_ pathway and are related to physiological routes important for high-altitude hypoxia response, such as those linked to increased angiogenesis, skeletal muscle adaptations, and immune functions at the fetus-maternal interface. Our results, combined with other studies, showed that Andeans have adapted to the Altiplano in different ways and using distinct molecular strategies as compared to those of other natives living at high altitudes.</p>"

summary: This study analyzed genomic data from Native Americans in the Andean highlands and lowland areas, identifying genes for high-altitude adaptation in Andeans related to the hypoxia response.
